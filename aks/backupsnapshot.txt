use static disk that's created outside of AKS
	static PV by creating one or more Azure managed disks
create the disk storage dynamically
	dynamically creating one or more Azure managed disks



	default: cost-effective Standard SSD storage
	managed-csi-premium: SSD-based high-performance, low-latency disk



Dynamically provision a volume

	Built-in storage classes
	A persistent volume claim (PVC) uses the storage class object to dynamically provision an Azure Disk storage container.

	
	
Statically provision a volume
	Azure disk for use with AKS, you can create the disk resource in the node resource group
	Azure disk from separate resource group requires a grant for AKS Contributor to disk Resource Group
	


Questions to clarify:
reclaimPolicy: controls the behavior of the underlying Azure storage resource when the pod is deleted
	retain or delete
