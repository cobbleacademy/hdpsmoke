Its been very short period I worked with team however based on my observation your engagement in the project is remarkable.
I would like to add few points in my words:

Valuable contribution towards team management and distributing the project tasks are amazing
Focused on team productivity in terms of tasks and their progress
Excellent way of implementing work strategies and feature & Tasks and their follow up
You proved me wrong that some important tasks may fall into cracks as breadth of project/team is huge but you always took care of them easily
Continuously bring brilliant points where product vendor can not able to ignore our project needs
Shows initiative in following up/escalating to higher management to get their attention to accomplish our project deliverables
As on-boarding more work and quality, you are always meet all expectations

This is a wonderful opportunity to work with you and looking forward into coming year.
