- Prepare array of struct with different size and modify a value in each struct using mapping doc and generate new array of struct

[{a:1,b:2,c:3},{a:5}] using (1->100,5->20) => [{a:100,b:2,c:3},{a:20}]

- Build an EventHub to receive events thru Event Subscription and invoke action

(Systems subscribe to event-hub which in-turn calls program/action)

- Build a process to reconcile the data between 2 layers

â€” Generate live graph on streaming data to find number of active users for an application

- Build an algorithm to sovle overlapping of numbers for given key

A   1   -   9
A   5   -  15
A  10   -  55
B   1   -  50
B  40  - 100
C   1   -   9
C   0   -  10
C   5   -  12
