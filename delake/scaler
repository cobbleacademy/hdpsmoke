I have my IT experience majorly in JAVA/J2EE and BigData technologies. 
In JAVA/J2EE developed several products/frameworks/applications.
In the products area developed StarBEAM datawarehouse tool using Swing/Applet/WebServices
In the framework area developed CFR Part-11 framework using JSF/EJB/WebServices
Implemented the framework and developed CAPA applications using JSF/EJB/WebServices
In BigData technology worked on different areas.
One of the area is building clusters varying from Apache vanilla, Hortonworks and Cloudera stacks
	Installing components hdfs/yarn/pig/hive/sqoop/spark/impala/zookeeper/kafka/flume etc
	Applying security and encryption on data at-rest/in-motion using encryption zone and TLS certs
	(Cloudera - Gazzang)
	
Another area is data ingestion into data lake from multiple sources 
 Relational databases,SalesForce,adobe,marketo,twitter using tools
 Keep the cleansed data ready for business use cases
Another area is developing Business use cases using rules or datascience models

***Privacera***
Secure data sharing across all business units with fine-grained access controls 
  down to file-, row-, and column-levels
Protects data with dynamic encryption, masking, and anonymization
Seamless integration with no performance impact

  controls across Azure cloud services, including including 
  ADLS, PowerBI, Cosmos, Synapse, and Azure Databricks
Full transparency of data access and usage
Trusted compliance with privacy and industry regulations like GDPR, LGPD, CCPA, HIPAA, and more
Enables complete visibility of data usage with rich auditing and reporting-- all from a centralized location.

***DLP***
Data --- motion/rest/inuse/in device/computer
---->
Data Identification or Classification (PII/GDPR)
data moves internally a lot - not routed where it shouldn't go
data at rest, -- databases/apps/devices/cloud storage/
end-point -- computes/mobile devices/tablets -- block data from being copied
data leak -- monitor for unusual behavior


***CASB***
Enterprise --- Cloud
Data exchange -- should be prevented if malicious data/attack detected
---->
control point of data in the cloud with wide range of security policies
inline proxy - stop data upload to cloud
data at rest or file uploads


***Qualys***
Web App/SQL Injection/Cross Site Scripting - monitor webapp firewall
---->
Virtual Appliance Scanner - Vulnerability Scanning -- EC2/AWS - to check if AWS policies are followed
Virtual Firewall Scanner - routers/switches/hubs/servers/databases/workstation/printers/devices
Container Scanner - Scan docker registry or running containers



***Zscaler***
users (from anywhere or device) ------ application/resources/web apps/saas apps
---->
Rich Authentication and Software Policy approach
Software defined policies - connect users apps
Access Policy - which apps are visible or dark
on-net off-net - identical protection
Right User to Right application in secured way
---->
Platform has 2 approaches
ZIA - Zscaler Internet Access
provides secure access to Internet/SaaS applications
to ensure no bad data comes in and leaves out
---
Inline content inspection/ real-time threat correlation / threat feeds

ZPA - Zscaler Private Access
Provides access to Internal Application either on cloud or datacenter without VPN
---
users never on the corporate network
apps are invisible not exposed to internet
secured without a VPN
segment apps


Splunk -Zscaler Cloud
----------------------
Splunk provides centralized log ingestion and analytics against Zscaler logs and normalized into Splunk’s schema.
Splunk ingests Zscaler high fidelity telemetry giving security teams visibility into their zero trust environment while enabling them to detect and eliminate emerging threats.
Splunk’s zero trust analytics dashboard provides robust analytics with Risk Based Alerting and User Entity Behavior Analytics to detect anamolies and abnormal patterns.
Splunk Phantom integrates with Zscaler API to automatically trigger event triage investigations and response actions.
